Should run as shown in the lectures with the front end running in one command prompt with npm run dev and the backend in another with node index.js.
The code I wrote focused on communication between a front end and back end written in react and node.js respectivly. The back end provided a random word from a read in csv to be scrambled and fed to the front end which allowed a user to guess what the unscrambled word was. It also allows the user to get a hint and update their score counts with buttons. 

I feel like I could have definetly cleaned up my code a lot more with more time and experience. To be honest, I was unfarmiliar with almost every concept I had to tackle coming into this assignment and know that the final product could have been better. I would have liked to flesh out my hint a lot more too.
